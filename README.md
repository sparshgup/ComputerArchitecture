# Computer Architecture

Sparsh Gupta

This repository has SystemVerilog implementations of computer architecture components using primarily structural combinational and some behavioral logic.

It also has an implementation for Conway's Game of Life and the RISC-V CPU (both in progress).

## List of components

- 1-bit adder
- N-bit adder 
- N-bit adder (carry look ahead)
- N-bit adder (prefix)
- Equal comparator
- Less than comparator
- Decoders
- Muxes
- Shifters (SLL, SRL, SRA)
- Register
- ALU (capable of performing AND, OR, XOR, Addition, Subtraction, SLL, SRL, SRA, SLT, SLTU)
- Pulse Generator
- PWM
- Edge Detector
- Triangle Generator

## RISC-V CPU

In Progress

## Conway's Game of Life

HDL Implementation using SystemVerilog of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Utilizes a [Cmod A7 FPGA Reference](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/cmod-a7/reference-manual) FPGA to simulate it on an 8x8 LED Display matrix.

## FPGA USB-UART communication

In progress
